<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
<h4>So you want to help but don't know how? Check this out: </h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Set up a working copy on your computer. (if you've forked it already go to #2! )</p>
 <p> Firstly you need a local fork of the the project<strong>(if you didn't already!)</strong>, so go ahead and press the "fork" button in GitHub.</p></li>
 <li> Then, create a branch for your new changes to sit in. It helps to call the branch something related to the changes you are going to make:(here hs-footer is the branchname, using your initials is a good idea to easily see who made the branch)</li>

    git checkout -b hs-footer
<li> Do some work. This is the fun bit where you get to contribute to the project.</li>
<li> After all changes are complete, (here branchname is hs-footer:)
   <ul>
   <li>git add --all</li>
   <li>git commit -m"message of changes"</li>
   <li>git push -u origin hs-footer</li>
   </ul></li>

<li> Go to <a href="https://github.com/djangogirlscodecamp/lightandleadership">django girls light and leadership github page.</a>. Your branch name will be there and a green button that says 'compare and pull request'.  Click it! </li>
<li>Review by the maintainers.</li>
<li>If sucessful your contributions will be accepted and merged to the master, if not check the comments and edit your code.</li>
</ol>
<p> Make sure to always 'git pull' before starting work on the project to keep it up to date. After you've finished your work 'git push -u branchname' to your local repo and if you've finished and are happy do a pull request. </p>
